Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the University of Pittsburgh. My research examines when voters punish incumbents for negative economic shocks, focusing on how these responses vary across different institutional arrangements. In my dissertation, I study how features of party systems, such as the fragmentation of electoral competition and the composition of governments, shape voters’ ability and incentives to assign responsibility. I simultaneously analyze how electoral system design conditions the electoral consequences of economic hardship, affecting whether parties and politicians associated with deprivation lose votes or office. Methodologically, I am interested in leveraving causal inference to identify both the effects of economic shocks and the mechanisms that underlie incumbent punishment.

I hold a BA in Social Sciences from the Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil (2022) and an MA in Political Science from the University of Pittsburgh (2024).
