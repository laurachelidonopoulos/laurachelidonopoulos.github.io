    Incumbent accountability is one of the main channels through which retrospective voting operates, often assessed through changes in vote share and reelection success. However, punishment may reduce an incumbent’s vote share without crossing the threshold for office turnover. Drawing on the 2014 Petrobras scandal and the global oil crisis, which decreased royalty inflows to resource-dependent Brazilian municipalities, I argue that economic shocks should produce punishment both in terms of vote loss and reduced survival in office. Using a differences-in-differences design, I provide causal evidence that mayoral incumbents lose votes in municipalities that suffered royalty losses, but their reelection success is not hindered. I further argue that the mechanism behind losing votes is an increase in the supply of challengers in the first election after the shock. Incumbents’ heightened vulnerability should incentivize contenders to run, as they perceive greater opportunities to win. Using post-shock royalty loss as an instrument for competition, I show that the shock’s effect on vote share operates through increased challenger entry. In particular, it shows that in Brazil’s single-member district plurality elections, economic downturns foster fragmentation rather than coordination, dispersing anti-incumbent votes across multiple competitors instead of concentrating them behind a single viable challenger. The study contributes to debates on retrospective voting, democratic accountability, and the political consequences of resource dependence.

    To what extent do copartisans overlook corruption in favor of their party? While existing research shows that partisanship can shield politicians from the consequences of corruption, the conditions under which this varies remain unclear. I argue that partisanship's effect on corruption voting depends on whether corruption is targeted (when the corrupt actor belongs to the voter's preferred party) or systemic (when the electorate perceives corruption to be widespread). These contexts activate different processes: biased interpretation and the weakening of partisan identity through broader disillusionment. Using a survey experiment in Brazil and public opinion data from 17 Latin American countries (2008--2018), I find that copartisans are more likely to excuse corruption when their party is implicated. However, as systemic corruption increases, they become more likely to withdraw support and defect to opposition parties. These findings show that copartisans’ tolerance of corruption is conditional and can become fragile under certain circumstances.
